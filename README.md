Spreadsheets are an essential application, for anyone needing to record and share tabular data.
While not the most exciting of applications, they are the workhorse of data analysis and professional services and provide an ideal application setting for studying data structures and their efficiencies.
In this assignment, we will focus on implementing data structures needed for developing a spreadsheet application. We will develop several data structures and compare their performances. 
These data structures are arrays (that is, Python list), linked lists and Compressed Sparse Rows (CSR), which will be further described below.
